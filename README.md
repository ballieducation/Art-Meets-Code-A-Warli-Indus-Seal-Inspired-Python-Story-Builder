# Art-Meets-Code-A-Warli-Indus-Seal-Inspired-Python-Story-Builder
This project is an educational storytelling game built with Python and Pygame, integrating art, culture, and computational thinking. Players arrange illustrated cards inspired by Warli art and Indus Valley seals to build meaningful narratives. The system uses gamification, analytics, and AI-inspired evaluation to measure story quality, planning, and usability (SUS & NASA-TLX). Designed for students, it strengthens lateral thinking, creativity, empathy, and cultural literacy. Includes features like quiz integration, auto story scoring, and visualization tools.
